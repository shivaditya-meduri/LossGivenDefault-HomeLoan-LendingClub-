# About the Dataset
The dataset used for the project is provided by LendingClub, an American peer-to-peer lending company
headquartered in San Francisco, California. It includes 2,260,701 unsecured personal loans between $1,000
and $40,000 that LendingClub issued over the 2007-2018 period. 886,753 of those loans are ongoing loans
that can ultimately turn out to be good or bad. Since their outcome is not clear, they will not be used in
the analysis. About 1,373,915 observations, on the other hand, have an outcome (fully paid or default). Our
analysis will be based on these data points.
The dataset includes 151 quantitative and qualitative features used by nancial institutions to determine
an applicant's creditworthiness. Some of those features are presented below.
1. Quantitative factors: loan amount, average transactions amount, assets, salary, age, etc.
2. Qualitative factors: marital status, education, employment sector, whether a person has a house,
whether a person has a car, etc
